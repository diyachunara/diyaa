# Web Development Internship - Day 2

## Task Overview
Today's task focused on building a foundational understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and debugging techniques.

## What I Learned

### 1. HTML Structure
- Created a semantic HTML5 page with Headers, Paragraphs, Lists (`ul/li`), Images, and Buttons.
- Understood the importance of valid tagging and proper nesting.

### 2. CSS Styling
- Applied basic styling including background colors, text alignment, and spacing.
- Implemented hover effects on buttons using pseudo-classes (`:hover`).

### 3. Debugging
- Created a `broken.html` file with intentional errors (syntax errors, overflow, broken links).
- Practiced reading code to identify issues like unclosed tags, typos (`</stlye>`), and CSS logic errors.
- Documented findings in `fix-notes.md`.

### 4. Version Control
- Managed project with Git (Init, Add, Commit).
- Created a commit history reflecting the development process:
    1.  Feature: Basic Page
    2.  Chore: Broken Page
    3.  Fix: Resolved Issues
